# NTT

## Mathematical Description
A detailed report is available in the `lectures` folder.

## Usage
The `main.py` file in the `main` folder contains the implementation of the NTT algorithm using various methods. An example input is stored in the `input.txt`. The `run_script.py` file in the `main` folder can be used to run the `main.py` file with the given input file.

 The following commands can be used to run the code:

```
cd main
python3 run_script.py "main.py" "input8.txt"
python3 run_script.py "main.py" "input4.txt"
```
